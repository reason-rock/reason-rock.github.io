<h3>Note</h3>
1. Open the charging door and connector cap before removing the bumper. (Charging connector is attached to chassis, But charging door and cap are attached on the bumper.)
2. Check that all the fasteners in the wheel house removed.
3. Unlike Ioniq EV, which can remove the bumper easily by grabbing the active shutter, the Niro EV has no convenient grabbing point, so make sure to wear a glove and be careful.
4. Do not forget to disconnect and connect the bumper harness connector, which is located on the right side of the bumper before removing and assembling the bumper.
5. Removal of the headlight is not essential. In this case, they were removed for work on the wheelhouse.
