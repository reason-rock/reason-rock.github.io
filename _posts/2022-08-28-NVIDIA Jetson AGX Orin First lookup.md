# NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin First lookup

<h4></h4>
I had a very very short time to tear off the package and use Orin.

<h4>Packaging</h4>
Because I didn't see the package of previous Jetson AGX Xavier, I can't compare both of them.
On my first impression, the packaging seemed like the Apple's one.

<h4>Appearence</h4>
On our system, Orin will alter the role of Xavier, so I compared the two things together.
Subjectively, Xavier seemed like semi-opened and looks more mechanical, But had disadventage of dust and shock without cover.

But Orin, which was fully covered even the PCIe slot, seemed more rigid, and beautiful. (But the PCIe cover disappointed me after a min...)

<h4>PCI slot</h4>
Orin has a rigid cover for PCI slot.
But after I opened the cover, it was very disappointed.
A wireless antenna was connected across the case and the main body.
I have no idea how to deal the cover when I use the PCI slot.

<h4>Size</h4>
Because our Xavier has a Type-C hub attached on the side and wider 3d printed feet, I could not compare precisely with Xavier. On my feeling, Orin seemed a slithly big, but the catalog spec says both of their size is same. This maybe the illusion caused from the fully enclosed design.

<h4>Ports</h4>
Ports were also slightly different.
The most biggest diffrence which made me impossible to boot was the change of display output port. Xavier has HDMI, But Orin has DP.
Because of this sad news, my post ends in this point.
I will try boot and setup with DP cable soon... :(
