<h1>Step 1. </h1>
It seemed that the general 'Intel realsense SDK' is not compatitable with RealSenseID(under RSID)
So we need to use RSID sdk from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/RealSenseID

Note
 1. Be careful when you use Secured option. It remains to the RSID device and cannot work with other pc. Make sure that disable Secured option before unplug

Trouble Shooting
1. $ [PacketSender] Got invalid crc. Expected: 561. Actual: 20100 error : Need to give permission to access to sub -> $ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
2. $ "Firmware cannot be updated directly to the chosen version.
Flash firmware version 3.1.#.# first.Firmware cannot be updated directly to the chosen version.
Flash firmware version 3.1.#.# first." : We cannot update the RSID firmware 2.x to 4.x directly, so we need to update 2.x -> 3.1.x -> 4.x
3. The SKU version of the firmware : There are two variations in same version. SKU1 and 2.
 We need to Check the serial number. If our RSID's serial number consisted with:
	120X6228XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXX
	122X6228XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXX
	XXXX6229XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXX
	We need to use SKU2 version. I was the first case.
 
 4. If you use OpenCV with RSID, the camera number may be -1
 5. Cannot find rsid.so : check build/lib folder

cd RealSenseID/build/bin
./rsid-cli /dev/ttyACM0

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $
