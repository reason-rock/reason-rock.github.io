<h3>Note</h3>
1. I thought the urethane-coated part was separated like a lid, but it is a whole part with the 'main crash pad assembly.'
2. Remove the 'cluster fascia panel' include the handle cover connected with the leather part.
3. Remove the plastic part carefully because the top of the 'cluster fascia panel' is thin.
4. Unlike the 'cluster fascia panel', the 'instrument cluster' has two additional screws at the top, requiring a total of four removal.
